## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Indigo (#4B0082) to evoke a sense of cinematic depth and focus, drawing inspiration from the deep, captivating hues often found in movie posters and theaters.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F0F0F0), a desaturated tint of indigo, for a clean, unobtrusive backdrop that enhances readability and allows movie posters to stand out.
- Accent color: Violet (#8A2BE2), an analogous color to indigo but with increased brightness and saturation, for highlighting interactive elements and calls to action, adding a touch of visual excitement.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern, clean and readable UI.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) used in headings for a futuristic, computerized look, contrasting the body font to guide the user's eye.
- Use a set of minimalistic icons. For example, a 'plus' icon can be used to add the movies to a user's watchlist. A trash can can be used to remove an item.
- Implement smooth transitions and loading animations to enhance user experience.
